# Industry Practicum 2020

How does a CPG firm with a massive online presence optimize its product strategy and channelize its marketing efforts when the biggest ecommerce platform Amazon shares only aggregated metrics instead of granular measures?

This is what our team solved for a New York based Fortune200 CPG firm, and designed an enhanced decision support system using machinelearning techniques, as a part of Industry Practicum Project, in around 3 months.

The following were the highlights/crux of the entire project:

•	Developed profitability prediction model at SKU-level granularity; designed real-time Tableau based decision support system for 425 ASINs
•	Performed K-means clustering for SKU segmentation; improved sales forecasting accuracy by 30% using ARIMA, LSTM to project $8 million savings in annual budget
•	Performed Trade Promotion Optimization (TPO) by forming new promotional groupings of low-profit SKUs to boost their sales through bundling technique
