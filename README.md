# Industry Practicum 2020

During the months of Jan-Mar, 2020, while pursuing MS in Business Analytics from Purdue University, my team and I worked for our industry partner as part of our industry capstone project. The partner was a New York based Fortune 200 CPG company.

We applied machine learning and prescriptive solutions in ecommerce analytics for the following business use cases:

  - Developed profitability prediction model at SKU-level granularity; built Tableau based decision support system for 425 ASINs. Model will help business augment marketing and supply chain when dealing with Amazon.com, Inc.
  - Formed new promotional groupings of SKUs for improved marketing as part of Trade Promotion Optimization by implementing profit    optimization using MILP
  - Projected $58 million increase in year-on-year revenue growth by improving sales forecasting by 25% using ARIMA and LSTM
