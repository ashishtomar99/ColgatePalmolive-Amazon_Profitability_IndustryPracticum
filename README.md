# ColgatePalmolive-Amazon

How does a CPG firm with a massive online presence optimize its product strategy and channelize its marketing efforts when the biggest ecommerce platform Amazon shares only aggregated metrics instead of granular measures?

This is what I solved for Colgate-Palmolive, and designed an enhanced decision support system using machine learning techniques, as a part of Industry Practicum Project.

The following were the highlights/crux of the entire project:

- Developed profitability prediction model at SKU-level granularity; designed real-time Tableau based decision support system for 425 ASINs
- Performed K-means clustering for SKU segmentation; improved sales forecasting accuracy by 30% using ARIMA, LSTM to project $8 million savings in annual budget
- Performed Trade Promotion Optimization (TPO) by forming new promotional groupings of low-profit SKUs to boost their sales through bundling technique
